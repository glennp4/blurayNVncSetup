# setup bluray, vlc, makemkv
----------------------------
1. according to GPT instructions go here [vlc-bluray.whoknowsmy.name](https://vlc-bluray.whoknowsmy.name/)
2. from there follow link for getting the keys database: [FindVUK Online Database](http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/)
3. according to instructions on [FindVUK Online Database](http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/) install updated VLC player from  [videolan.org](https://www.videolan.org/)
4. according to instructions on [FindVUK Online Database](http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/) download JRE and setup
   - we deviated from the instructions by installing the latest JRE globally without a batch file instead of the one they recommended only in VLC directory with a batch file
6. (according to instructions on [FindVUK Online Database](http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/) go to [this blog post](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1886086#post1886086) and follow ["How To (Windows)"](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1886086#post1886086:~:text=is%20not%20available-,How%20To%20(Windows)%3A,-Put%20the%2032) section
7. Install MakeMKV from https://www.makemkv.com/
   - We installed a "beta" version (it's actually the same executable, we just didn't pay for a registration key).
     The website says that it will stop working after 60 days. The program says 30 days. The web site itself says
     that you can reset the time re-download and re-install the latest version when the installed version stops working.
     So I don't think there are any ethical problems with not paying so long as you don't mind re-instlaling
     every 60 days (it was pretty fast).
8. Run MakeMKV
9. View > Preferences > Integration > check all boxes ... click "OK"

11. Wait for it to scan and identify the drive
12. When drive is identified, click the drive diagram in the MakeMKV gui and wait for it to scan/decrypt the disk
13. When MakeMVK shows the data on the disc it is ready
